How to use I2C library for LCD 16x2 Display
___________________________________________

This library is designed to use a 16x2 LCD Display connected to an I2C IO-Expander 
module, like Arduino's one.

Files: 	LcdI2cLib.c
	LcdI2cLib.h
	I2cLib.c
	I2cLib.h

Copy these new files in Avr "lib" folder of your ldmicro workspace.

Edit I2cLib.c with any text editor and replace in line :
#define LCD_I2C_ADR		0x00
the final value 0x00 by the I2C address of your I2C module (maybe 0x27)
according to its documentation

In LdMicro32, create a ladder using I2C Write function and use this address
to access LCD display, with 'register' field= 255
(this value can also be modified in library as above if need be)

In the 'send variable' field, you can put a variable or a value, knowing that
there are 3 possibilities:

- values between 0 and 0x10 are commands (described in libraries):
 	0= Erase display
	1= Cursor home
	2= Blinking display
	3= Normal display

	Other values / functions can be added in libraries.

- values above 0x80 are move commands to move cursor to line y, col x:
	bit  7= 1
	bits 6-5= y-1	allows 4 lines 1->4	
	bits 4-0= x-1	allows 32 columns 1->32

	Example: 0xA5 = 1 01 00101 will move cursor to line 2, column 6

- other values betwen 0x11 and 0x7F are standard chars to display at cursor position.

It normally doesn't prevent to use other I2C devices on the same bus.
